The researchers found that actinic keratoses increased the risk for SCC most. They also found that the absolute risk for any skin cancer after actinic keratoses increased over time. The researchers concluded that actinic keratoses are not a biological precursor of melanoma or basal cell cancer, but they increase the risk for skin cancer generally and SCC, particularly over time as a clinical sign of UV exposure."

		"question": "A 63-year-old woman presents with a non-healing lesion on her right temple that has been present for over two years. On examination there is a 6 mm well defined lesion with central ulceration, telangiectasia and a shiny, rolled edge. What is the treatment of choice for this lesion?",
		"opa": "Superficial radiotherapy",
		"opb": "Excision with 2 mm margins",
		"opc": "Excision with 4 mm margins",
		"opd": "Mohs micrographic surgery",
		"answer": "opc",
		"type":"single answer",
		"source": "Dermatology postgraduate MCQs and revision notes. CRC Press",
		"commentary": "In this question the patient has a lesion clinically typical of a small basal cell carcinoma. Suitable treatments would include excision and radiotherapy. Given the relatively young age of patient, excision with appropriate 4 mm margins would give a better cosmetic outcome than radiotherapy in the long run."

		"question": "You review a 38-year-old woman who presented two years previously with a 5.4 mm Breslow thickness melanoma on her ankle. The melanoma was removed with a 3 cm wide excision and a split skin graft was used to cover the defect. She re-presented two weeks ago with a blue-black nodule adjacent to the skin graft and palpable lymphadenopathy in the ipsilateral groin. Fine needle aspiration of the lump and groin lymph nodes has shown melanoma and a CT scan has shown no further evidence of metastatic spread. What treatment would you recommend for this patient?",
		"opa": "excision of the local cutaneous metastasis and radiotherapy to the groin",
		"opb": "excision of the local cutaneous metastasis and selective removal of enlarged lymph nodes in the groin",
		"opc": "excision of the local cutaneous metastasis and block lymph node dissection in the groin",
		"opd": "isolated limb infusion of the leg",
		"answer": "opc",
		"type":"single answer",
		"source": "Dermatology postgraduate MCQs and revision notes. CRC Press",
		"commentary": "In this question a young woman is presenting with loco-regional recurrence of a thick melanoma from her leg. Appropriate treatment would be excision of the local metastasis and block lymph node dissection of the groin by an experienced melanoma surgeon. Selective removal of enlarged lymph nodes would be unsatisfactory due to the likelihood of micrometastasis in other local lymph nodes. There is no role for radiotherapy or isolated limb infusion in the patient at this stage."

		"question": "A 28-year-old woman presents with a history of a longstanding mole on her leg that has recently increased in size and become darker. On examination the mole stands out, it has an irregular, ill-defined border, variation in colour and it lacks symmetry. You excise the mole with 2 mm clinical margins. Histopathology reports a fully excised invasive melanoma, Breslow thickness 0.2 mm, Clark level II and no ulceration. What further treatment should you recommend?",
		"opa": "re-excision of 8 mm around the scar",
		"opb": "re-excision of 1 cm around the scar",
		"opc": "re-excision of 2 cm around the scar",
		"opd": "refer for radiotherapy",
		"answer": "opa",
		"type":"single answer",
		"source": "Dermatology postgraduate MCQs and revision notes. CRC Press",
		"commentary": "When melanoma is suspected the lesion should be excised in full with a margin of 2 mm. In this question the patient has had a 2 mm margin diagnostic excision of a thin, 0.2 mm melanoma. In accordance with guidelines a further 8 mm of tissue should be removed bringing the total excision margin to 1 cm. Radiotherapy has no place in the treatment of primary melanoma although it may be used for palliative treatment of metastatic disease."

		"question": "An 81-year-old woman presents with a rapidly growing lesion on her right helix. On examination there is a 2 cm diameter, well defined, skin coloured nodule with a central keratin plug. You suspect a diagnosis of keratoacanthoma. What treatment option should you recommend?",
		"opa": "radiotherapy",
		"opb": "incisional biopsy",
		"opc": "excision biopsy",
		"opd": "curettage and cautery",
		"answer": "opc",
		"type":"single answer",
		"source": "Dermatology postgraduate MCQs and revision notes. CRC Press",
		"commentary": "In this question the patient should undergo an excision biopsy with minimal surgical margins. With other forms of skin biopsy the pathologist will not be able to diagnose keratoacanthoma as they need to examine the architecture of the whole lesion."

		"question": "You review a 53-year-old man from whom you have excised a well differentiated SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) arising on the scalp within an area of Bowen’s disease, lesion diameter 21 mm, invading 5 mm into the deep dermis, fully excised with 2 mm histological margins; clinically 5 mm surgical margins were taken and the lesion was excised to the depth of subcutaneous fat. What treatment option is most appropriate for this lesion?",
		"opa": "lesion doesn't require further treatment",
		"opb": "lesion requires re-excision",

		"answer": "opb",
		"type":"single answer",
		"source": "Dermatology postgraduate MCQs and revision notes. CRC Press",
		"commentary": "In this question, lesion should be considered high risk. Although well differentiated it has arisen within an area of Bowen’s disease, it measures over 2 cm in diameter and invades over 4 mm into the deep dermis. It has been excised with a relatively narrow peripheral margin of 5 mm and a shallow deep margin of subcutaneous fat. This lesion should be re-excised to the depth of the aponeurosis and a cumulative peripheral margin of between 7 and 10 mm."
